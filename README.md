# Brewery-Coding-Challenge

A coding challenge given to me by a company I interviewed for.

The challenge was to render a webpage that displays a map showing California beer breweries using a maps API and the Open Brewery DB API. I used the Google Maps API.

The challenge was to do this in under one hour, however I took longer as this was one of my first times using JavaScript and Web APIs.
